## Gives GDB info about where symbols are!
##   use kernel.elf for debugging post-MMU code
##   use pre_mmu.elf for debugging pre-MMU code
file kernel.elf

## May not be necessary?
set architecture aarch64

## Connect to qemu remotely on port 9000

## Gets us a nice GUI
tui enable
layout regs

## These are useful for waiting until the MMU has been setup and we're in the
## main C function. If you debug the startup asm, you'll want to comment these
## out and do 4 stepi instructions (to get past some firmware instructions). If
## you want to debug processes, uncomment "break *0x20000000".
#break *0x20000000
#break main
#continue
